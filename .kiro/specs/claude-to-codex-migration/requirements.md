# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is currently designed and developed with Claude Code as the foundation, but it needs to be completely migrated to a Codex CLI-based system. This migration will fundamentally change project dependencies, CLI calls, prompt structures, configuration management, and other aspects to rebuild the system optimized for Codex CLI characteristics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the current Claude Code-dependent system to a Codex CLI-based system so that I can leverage the advantages of Codex CLI while maintaining existing functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is started THEN code generation functionality SHALL work using Codex CLI
2. WHEN existing prompts are executed THEN they SHALL be processed in a format optimized for Codex CLI
3. WHEN configuration files are loaded THEN Codex CLI-related configuration items SHALL be correctly recognized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to update CLI settings and provider settings so that the transition from Claude Code to Codex CLI is properly managed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are updated THEN Codex CLI execution path and configuration options SHALL be applied
2. WHEN providers are initialized THEN Codex CLI provider SHALL be used instead of Claude Code provider
3. IF Codex CLI is not available THEN appropriate error messages and installation instructions SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want prompts and templates to be optimized for Codex CLI so that the quality and accuracy of generated code improves

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompts are generated THEN they SHALL be created with a structure that conforms to Codex CLI input format
2. WHEN code generation is executed THEN high-quality code SHALL be output leveraging Codex CLI characteristics
3. WHEN templates are used THEN prompt templates optimized for Codex CLI SHALL be applied

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to confirm that agent functionality works with Codex CLI so that existing agent features operate normally in the new system

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are executed THEN they SHALL be properly processed through Codex CLI
2. WHEN spec-related agents operate THEN Codex CLI SHALL be used in each phase of requirements, design, tasks, and implementation
3. WHEN agent coordination occurs THEN it SHALL operate normally in the Codex CLI-based execution environment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate while maintaining existing file structure and settings so that the migration is completed with minimal breaking changes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is executed THEN the structure of existing spec, steering, and prompt files SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN configuration files are updated THEN existing functional settings SHALL be maintained while Codex CLI settings are added
3. WHEN file paths or directory structures are referenced THEN existing path structures SHALL continue to be used

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that the post-migration system is properly tested so that all major functionality is verified to work correctly in the Codex CLI environment

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test suites are executed THEN all unit tests SHALL pass in the Codex CLI environment
2. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN end-to-end functionality SHALL operate correctly with Codex CLI
3. WHEN performance tests are executed THEN the Codex CLI-based system SHALL maintain acceptable response times

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that error handling and logging functionality support the Codex CLI environment so that diagnosis and response can be performed appropriately when problems occur

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in Codex CLI execution THEN appropriate error messages and logs SHALL be recorded
2. WHEN Codex CLI processes fail THEN appropriate retry logic or fallback processing SHALL be executed
3. WHEN Codex CLI is not available THEN clear error messages and setup instructions SHALL be provided

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to achieve language unification across the entire project so that all documentation and source comments are written in English

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source code files are updated THEN all comments SHALL be written in English
2. WHEN documentation files are updated THEN all content SHALL be written in English
3. WHEN configuration files or descriptions are updated THEN all text SHALL be written in English
