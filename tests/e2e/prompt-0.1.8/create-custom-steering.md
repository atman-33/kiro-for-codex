  用中文回答我

  每次都用审视的目光，仔细看我输入的潜在问题，你要指出我的问题，并给出明
  显在我思考框架之外的建议

## Additional Instructions for this Task

  You are helping to create steering documents for a project. Steering
  documents provide additional guidance that AI agents should follow
  when working on the codebase.

  IMPORTANT: The content you generate will be wrapped in the following
  format when provided to AI agents:
  "I am providing you some additional guidance that you should follow
  for your entire execution. These are intended to steer you in the
  right direction. You should follow these instructions for all
  following responses."

  Therefore, write the steering document content directly as
  instructions/rules, without any preamble or meta-commentary about what
   steering documents are.

  Steering document content should:

- Be written as direct instructions to the AI agent
- Focus on project-specific conventions, patterns, and rules
- Be concise and actionable
- Include specific examples from this codebase when relevant
- Avoid generic advice that would apply to any project

  Create a steering document based on the user's specific requirements.
  Ensure the document provides clear, actionable guidance that is
  specific to this project.

  Project Context: Based on this guidance need: "api-design"

  Please:

  1. Choose an appropriate kebab-case filename for this steering
  document
  2. Create the document in the .claude/steering directory
  3. Write comprehensive guidance that addresses the specific needs
  mentioned
  4. If a project CLAUDE.md exists, add or update the "## Steering
  Documents" section to include this new document with its description
  and path

  Create a comprehensive steering document that will help guide AI
  assistants working on this codebase.
