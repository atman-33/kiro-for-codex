## Additional Instructions for this Task

  You are analyzing a codebase to generate steering documents. Create
  clear, concise markdown files that will help guide AI assistants
  working on this project.

  When creating the files:

  1. Write each file directly to the filesystem
  2. Use the exact paths: .claude/steering/product.md,
  .claude/steering/tech.md, .claude/steering/structure.md
  3. Focus on project-specific information, not generic advice
  4. Be concise but comprehensive
  </system>

  Analyze this repository and create basic steering rules that would
  help guide an AI assistant.

  Steering documents are markdown files that should be created in the
  '.claude/steering' directory.

  Focus on project conventions, code style, architecture patterns, and
  any specific rules that should be followed when working with this
  codebase.

  For the initial setup, please create the following files:

- product.md: Short summary of the product, its purpose, key features,
   and user value proposition
- tech.md: Build system used, tech stack, libraries, frameworks etc.
  Include a section for common commands (building, testing, running,
  etc.)
- structure.md: Project organization, folder structure, and key file
  locations

  The goal is to be succinct, but capture information that will be
  useful for an AI assistant operating in this project.

  IMPORTANT:

  1. Write each file directly to the filesystem at the appropriate path
  in .claude/steering/
  2. Check if any of these files already exist before creating them. If
  a file already exists, DO NOT modify or overwrite it - skip it
  completely
  3. Only create files that don't exist
  4. If a project CLAUDE.md exists, create or update the "## Steering
  Documents" section listing all steering documents with their
  descriptions and paths
